# Gamified Intervention for Stress Relief [GISR]

Join us on a journey to explore how gamification can influence
emotional states.
Our real-time face recognition technology continuously monitors
your emotions as you play.

## Overview

The Gamified Intervention for Stress Relief project aims to develop an innovative intervention system using facial recognition technology and machine learning models. The system is designed to assist individuals in managing stress levels through gamification techniques.

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, stress has become a prevalent issue affecting people from all walks of life. Traditional methods of stress management often lack engagement and may not be accessible to everyone. This project seeks to address this challenge by leveraging facial recognition technology and machine learning algorithms to create a personalized stress relief experience.

## Features

- **ML based Facial Recognition**: The system utilizes facial recognition technology to analyze users' facial expressions and detect signs of stress or tension.

- **Gamification**: The intervention process is gamified to enhance user engagement and motivation. Users can participate in interactive activities and challenges designed to alleviate stress.

- **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their stress levels and monitor their progress over time through intuitive visualizations and analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **Facial Recognition**: OpenCV
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Keras.
- **Backend**: Flask, Firebase (for user authentication and data storage).
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashwinsk24/GISRv2.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Firebase authentication:

   - Create a Firebase project and configure authentication.
   - Update Firebase credentials in the Flask app.

4. Run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   flask run 
   ``` 
   or
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application in your web browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Usage
